The crux of the idea here is that we remember the most extreme examples and are most engaged with extreme examples, but at the same time, we remember the most extreme examples for outgroups that we don't actually see.At the same time, we know lots of people in person and are inclined to see our in-group as the average of the group, not the extreme outlier. Because you know that there aren't many extreme outliers. You're part of that group.

The Internet has made these two biases block horns because we are largely geographically self-segregated, but we can come into contact with pictures, videos, and text from people all over.

{"name":"qipo","tagline":"Your group messenger, calendar, and to-do list, synced across all platforms.  Stop managing your tools, and start working with people.","body":"### Welcome to qipo.\r\nqipo is the communal productivity platform you've always wanted.  We make getting things done with a group **frictionless**.\r\n\r\n### Disconnected tools make you inefficient.\r\nYour different productivity tools can't integrate with each other, forcing you to coordinate them yourself.  We bring your calendar, to-do list, and messaging into one system so you can focus on your work, not your tools.\r\n\r\n### Your tools don't get your groups.\r\nTraditional productivity tools lead to duplicated work and lost knowledge because they focus on individuals and ignore the greater group.  We prevent that by collecting your community's workflow into one centralized system.\r\n\r\n### We are your automagical documentation.\r\nqipo organizes your workflow based on what you're working on, rather than who you're working with.  This creates a durable, transparent, and organically organized record of all your community's knowledge.\r\n\r\n### Your group's workflow, visualized and optimized.\r\nCollecting this workflow lets us give you the most complete picture of your community.  Our industry-grade AI algorithms and visualizations power live reporting tools which will help you understand your organization better than ever before.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

    <p>qipo is the communal productivity platform you've always wanted.  We make getting things done with a group <strong>frictionless</strong>.</p>

      <a id="disconnected-tools-make-you-inefficient" class="anchor" href="#disconnected-tools-make-you-inefficient" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Disconnected tools make you inefficient.</h2>

    <p>Your different productivity tools can't integrate with each other, forcing you to coordinate them yourself.  We bring your calendar, to-do list, and messaging into one system so you can focus on your work, not your tools.</p>

    <h2>
      <a id="your-tools-dont-get-your-groups" class="anchor" href="#your-tools-dont-get-your-groups" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Your tools don't get your groups.</h2>

    <p>Traditional productivity tools lead to duplicated work and lost knowledge because they focus on individuals and ignore the greater group.  We prevent that by collecting your community's workflow into one centralized system.</p>

    <h2>
      <a id="we-are-your-automagical-documentation" class="anchor" href="#we-are-your-automagical-documentation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>We are your automagical documentation.</h2>

    <p>qipo organizes your workflow based on what you're working on, rather than who you're working with.  This creates a durable, transparent, and organically organized record of all your community's knowledge.</p>

    <h2>
      <a id="your-groups-workflow-visualized-and-optimized" class="anchor" href="#your-groups-workflow-visualized-and-optimized" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Your group's workflow, visualized and optimized.</h2>

    <p>Collecting this workflow lets us give you the most complete picture of your community.  Our industry-grade AI algorithms and visualizations power live reporting tools which will help you understand your organization better than ever before.</p>
    <h2>Interested?</h2>
    <p>We're working as fast as we can to get our prototype ready for mass roll-out.  If you'd like to be a tester, <a href="mailto:beta@qipo.io?Subject=Beta%20Testing">send us an email!</a></p>
